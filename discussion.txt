Explain why it is not safe for a server receiving form data to trust the data, even if JavaScript was used to validate the data.?
The client-side validation is running on the client's web browser. An attacker can easily manipulate and bypass the client's side validation.
So the server cannot accept the javascript validation on the client's side. The validation does not ensure data integrity and security.
An attacker can also submit malicious data. The users without the javascript enabled may create accessibility issues and may provide an inadequate user experience.
So server-side validation is essential to ensure data integrity, security, and consistency.
