Explain why it is not safe for a server receiving form data to trust the data, even if JavaScript was used to validate the data.?
If JavaScript is used to validate the data the customer enters in the form, for a server it is not safe to trust these data.
The validation on client side happens in client's browser. An attacker can manipulate this data.
The data sending from the client side can be manipulated by an attacker which causes problems to data integrity.
So server side validation is essential which ensures validation checks, protect against security vulnerabilities like cross site scripting attacks.
Thus the server side validation ensures more security against threats, ensures data integrity and enforces security policies.
