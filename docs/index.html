                <h3> What is web programming?</h3>
                <p>Web programming refers to the process of creating web applications and websites that are accessed over the internet.<br> It involves writing, coding, and markup languages that are used in web development. The most common languages used for web programming are HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Perl 5, and PHP</p>
                <h3>What is web security?</h3>
                <p>Web security is a broad category of security solutions that protect your users, devices, and wider network against internet-based cyberattacks—malware, phishing, and more—that can lead to breaches and data loss1.<br> It reduces the security risk to your organization when your users accidentally access malicious files and websites through firewall, IPS, sandboxing, URL filtering, and other security and access controls2</p>
